# DeepSeek-Inspired Language Model Implementation

A PyTorch implementation of a language model inspired by DeepSeek architecture, featuring Multi-Query Attention with Lossless Attention (MLHA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) with load balancing.

## Architecture Features

### Multi-Query Attention with Lossless Attention (MLHA)
- 8 attention heads with 2 key-value heads
- Efficient attention computation with reduced memory footprint
- Rotary positional embeddings
- Pre-norm architecture with RMSNorm

### Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- 4 expert networks with load balancing
- Expert capacity factor of 2
- MoE layers at positions [2, 4, 6]
- Loss-less load balancing for optimal expert utilization

### Model Configuration
- Hidden size: 512
- Intermediate size: 2048
- Number of layers: 8
- Vocabulary size: 50,257 (GPT-2 tokenizer)
- Maximum sequence length: 512
- SiLU activation function
